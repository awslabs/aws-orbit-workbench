These artifacts are to be deployed to a PUBLIC bucket for access.

The script prep_trial.sh creates a ZIP file and stages all files on the designated S3 public bucket

The bucket MUST be organized as such:
{bucketname}/deploy/trial.zip
{bucketname}/deploy/trial_pipeline_cfn.yaml
{bucketname}/deploy/buildspec/buildspec.yaml


*** buildspec.yaml MUST be in the trial.zip AND placed in the {bucketname}/deploy/buildspec/buildspec.yaml location!!


Files necessary for trial.zip:
    add_user.py
    buildspec.yaml
    demo-lake-admin-cfn-template.yaml
    demo-lake-creator-cfn-template.yaml
    demo-lake-user-cfn-template.yaml
    lake-admin-plugins.yaml
    lake-creator-plugins.yaml
    lake-user-plugins.yaml
    trial-manifest.yaml
    trial_pipeline_cfn.yaml

** NOTE: the buildspec will fetch the versioned manifests from github, if it doesn't find them, then the ones
in the trial.zip file are used
