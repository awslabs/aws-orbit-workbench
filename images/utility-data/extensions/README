The extensions/ dir is a placeholder directory..and is meant to be empty.  It is meant to store VSIX drivers to bake into an image.

BUT we should NOT store binary images in github...so you need to run script to fetch the image
BEFORE creating a new image, run the get_extensions.sh from this directory to fetch it.

Or browse to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/mtxr/vsextensions/sqltools-driver-pg/0.2.0/vspackage
and download it....
