*****  LOOK!!!!!  READ THIS!!!  *****
This image NEEDS to be build from the /aws-orbit-workbench directory so we can include the samples dir and cli/aws_orbit/data/cms/schema dir!!!!!

REF: docker build -t public.ecr.aws/v3o4w1g6/aws-orbit-workbench/utility-data  -f images/utility-data/Dockerfile .

The extensions/ dir is a placeholder directory....and is meant to be empty.  It is meant to store VSIX drivers to bake into an image.

BUT we should NOT store binary images in github...so you need to run script to fetch the image

Or browse to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/mtxr/vsextensions/sqltools-driver-pg/0.2.0/vspackage
and download it....
