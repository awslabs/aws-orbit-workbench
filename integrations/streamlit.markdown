whatIs: "Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Create beautiful data apps in hours, not weeks. All in pure Python."

AWS Orbit Workbench can run a Streamlit server as an [App](../documentation#apps) in a [team space](../documentation#team-space).
This means you can develop Jupyter notebooks and share the results with your organisation, quickly moving from experiment to
production.
