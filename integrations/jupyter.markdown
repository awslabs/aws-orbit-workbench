AWS Orbit Workbench can run a Jupyter server as an [App](../documentation#apps) in a [team space](../documentation#team-space).
This means that members of the team can run Jupyter notebooks and use them to interact with AWS services.  For example, you could
create a notebook that extracts a training set from Amazon Redshift, uses TensorFlow to build a model and write the results 
back to Amazon S3.
