AWS Orbit Workbench can run a Visual Studio Code server as an [App](../documentation#apps) in a [team space](../documentation#team-space).
This means that members of the team can have access to a rich IDE to work on data projects.

Visual Studio Code has its own rich eco-system of extensions, so you use the environment to interact with AWS Services.
Since you are running within AWS Orbit Workbench, your access to services is taken care of by environment - you can access
exactly the same set of services and data from within the environment as you can from any other part of AWS Orbit Workbench.
