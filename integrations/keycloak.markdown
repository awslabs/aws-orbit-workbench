AWS Orbit Workbench uses Amazon Cognito to provide SSO integration and basic authentication.  By adding KeyCloak as an Identity Provider to the Cognito `User Pool`, SSO authentication can be handled by KeyCloak or Amazon Cognito or both!

See our [Documentation](/aws-orbit-workbench/keycloak-integration) for details on configurations!
